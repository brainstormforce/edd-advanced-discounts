== Description ==

This is an addon for Easy Digital Downloads plugin that allows - 

+ Adding discount code for particular product variation
+ Setting a maximum cart total limit that will be discounted

Discounts are a great medium to encourage users to buy products! 

This plugin allows customizing discounts for product variations and cart total. Such strategic discounts can eventually bring more sales and profit to your store.


**Discount Code for Product Variations**

Easy Digital Downloads plugin allows offering discounts on selected products. But you don't get the option to choose particular product variations. 

For example - A product X has two variations - Annual ($100) and Lifetime ($300). The discount set by the EDD plugin will be applied to both. But in case you need to offer a discount only on Annual variation, EDD doesn't have any possibility. 

This is where the EDD Advanced Discounts plugin helps. 

This will offer a field where you can choose exact variations to apply a discount on. That means in the above example, you can apply the discount only on the Annual ($100) package of product X.


**Maximum Cart Total Limit That Will Be Discounted**

With EDD plugin you can set a minimum cart amount that will be eligible to avail the discount. But sometimes you might need to set a maximum limit as well. 

EDD Advanced Discounts plugin offers a condition to set maximum limit. The discount offered will not be applied above this maximum cart purchase limit. 

For example - Imagine you are running a sale with 30% off on all products. This can bring a balanced amount for lower plans/purchases. Like Plan A has an original price of $60 and the discounted price will be $42.

But higher plans/purchases might not be suitable for this discount. Like cart has a total of  $900 and after the discount, it will be $630. So you might not wish to compromise $270.

**How To Use This Plugin?**

This is a simple plugin. Just install it and options will be added under Downloads > Discount Codes. 

You can choose product variations with a setting - Product Requirements, and 
add maximum limit with a setting - Maximum Amount

**Note**: 
1. As this is an addon for Easy Digital Downloads plugin make sure it is activated 
2. EDD Download Requirements setting available under Downloads > Discount Codes will not be effective with this plugin.
